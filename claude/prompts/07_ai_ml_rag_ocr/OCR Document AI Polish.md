# OCR Document AI Polish — Intake, Extraction, Confidence, and Review Flow

## Mode

- Use the active `CLAUDE.md` context if present, then repository evidence.
- Work in the current Claude Code Cloud session. Do not assume hidden background runs or extra delegation mechanisms unless the user explicitly provides them.
- Implementation mode: change the repository when a focused OCR/document-AI improvement is justified by current evidence.

## Goal

Improve one coherent document-processing surface across intake, extraction contract, confidence handling, human review, export, and validation. The diff should make the selected document workflow safer and more complete, not merely rename a label or tweak one parser branch.

## Scope selection

- If the user named a document type, field, table, upload flow, correction UI, export, or extraction bug, polish that surface and directly affected states.
- If the request is broad, inspect current document-AI surfaces and choose the highest-confidence improvement with meaningful user/operator impact.
- Include related fixtures, evals, copy, telemetry, and downstream contract fixes when they belong to the same document workflow.
- Avoid provider/model swaps, large data migrations, and unrelated ingestion redesign unless required by the task or repo evidence.

## Polish targets

- File validation, upload constraints, preprocessing, page ordering, extraction schema, locale parsing, confidence thresholds, and typed field states.
- Low-confidence, unsupported-format, partial-extraction, retry, duplicate-job, correction, export, deletion, and permission states.
- Human review UX: clear labels, editable vs generated fields, validation messages, audit trail, and safe diagnostics.
- Downstream API/DB/export alignment and directly affected tests/evals/fixtures.
- Privacy boundaries: no unnecessary document/PII logging, no public internal error details.

## Implementation principles

- Apply changes at the owning pipeline or schema boundary rather than duplicating parser fixes downstream.
- Preserve existing storage, queue, OCR provider, and export architecture unless the task explicitly requires changing it.
- Keep extracted-data claims honest: distinguish missing, unknown, low-confidence, corrected, and verified values when the product model supports it.
- Update directly affected tests, eval fixtures, docs, and generated maps when the repo uses them.

## Validation

Run relevant repository-native checks and any document/OCR eval or fixture test that protects the changed path. If real document fixtures, provider keys, or queues are unavailable, run deterministic tests and state the exact gap.

## Final response

Respond in Russian with compact emoji sections: ♻️ changed document surface, 📁 key files, 🔎 evidence anchors, 🧪 checks/evals, 👀 manual review/trace, ⚠️ assumptions/risks, ⛔ not run/not included.
