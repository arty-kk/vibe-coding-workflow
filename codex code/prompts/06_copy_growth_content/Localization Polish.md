# Localization Polish — i18n, Locale Formatting, and Copy Consistency

## Mode

- Use the active `AGENTS.md` chain.
- Execute mode: change the repository when changes are justified by current evidence.

## Goal

Improve a coherent localization surface: missing strings, inconsistent keys, hardcoded user-facing copy, pluralization, interpolation, locale formatting, and translated state coverage.

## Scope selection

- If the user named a locale, surface, namespace, component, or issue, polish that area and directly affected states.
- If the request is broad, inspect high-traffic user-facing surfaces and i18n catalogs, then apply the highest-confidence fixes.
- Include directly related empty/loading/error/no-access/validation/destructive copy when they belong to the same namespace or journey.
- Avoid broad translation rewrites, new locales, vendor integrations, and tone changes unless requested.

## Localization targets

- Hardcoded user-facing strings where the repo uses catalogs.
- Missing, stale, duplicate, or inconsistent translation keys/namespaces.
- Interpolation, pluralization, gender/case-sensitive phrasing where supported.
- Locale-aware dates, numbers, currencies, percentages, sorting, and relative time.
- Validation/error/status copy, accessibility labels, metadata, notifications, and bot/web platform-specific copy.
- Fallback behavior and key naming consistency.

## Implementation principles

- Reuse existing i18n library, namespace strategy, key style, formatting helpers, and content vocabulary.
- Preserve business meaning and avoid unsupported marketing/product claims.
- Keep untranslated placeholders explicit if a real translation cannot be safely inferred.
- Update directly affected tests, snapshots, docs, and generated catalogs when the repo uses them.

## Validation

Run relevant repository-native checks. When explaining non-obvious repo facts, skipped adjacent work, or detected behavior, cite `path:line[-line]` where useful.

Spot-check at least one affected locale/render path where possible.

## Final response

Respond in Russian with compact emoji sections: ♻️ changed surfaces, 📁 key files, 🧪 checks, 👀 manual review/trace, ⚠️ assumptions/risks, ⛔ not run/not included.
