# RAG Polish — Retrieval, Grounding, Citations, and Answer States

## Mode

- Use the active `AGENTS.md` chain.
- Execute mode: change the repository when a focused RAG improvement is justified by current evidence.

## Goal

Improve one coherent RAG surface across retrieval quality, source grounding, citation behavior, empty/low-confidence states, freshness, and validation. The diff should make the selected answer path materially more trustworthy, not merely tweak a prompt string.

## Scope selection

- If the user named a feature, route, command, retriever, document type, answer bug, or query class, polish that surface and directly affected ingestion/retrieval/answer states.
- If the request is broad, inspect current RAG surfaces and choose the highest-confidence improvement with visible user or operator impact.
- Include related eval, fixture, telemetry, copy, source-rendering, and cache/freshness fixes when they belong to the same RAG behavior.
- Avoid provider swaps, vector DB migrations, broad reindexing, and model changes unless the repo/user evidence requires them.

## Polish targets

- Query preparation, filters, metadata, top-k/rerank parameters, chunk display, answer prompt boundaries, and source/citation rendering.
- Empty, low-confidence, partial-ingestion, stale-index, deleted-source, permission-denied, loading, error, retry, and timeout states.
- Source attribution, user-safe uncertainty, generated-content labels, and claims that must be backed by retrieved context.
- Ingestion status, reindex triggers, cache invalidation, idempotency, and operator recovery when directly tied to the selected surface.
- Tests/evals that protect the changed retrieval, citation, ACL, or answer behavior.

## Implementation principles

- Apply changes at the owner layer: loader/chunker/indexer/retriever/prompt/renderer/eval, not by duplicating local guards.
- Preserve existing model/provider/index architecture unless the task explicitly requires changing it.
- Keep answer claims truthful and traceable to current retrieved context.
- Do not log raw private documents, secrets, or unredacted user prompts.
- Update directly affected tests, eval fixtures, docs, and generated maps when the repo uses them.

## Validation

Run relevant repository-native checks and any RAG eval/test script that protects the changed path. If live indexes, provider keys, or fixtures are unavailable, run the deterministic parts and state the exact gap.

## Final response

Respond in Russian with compact emoji sections: ♻️ changed RAG surface, 📁 key files, 🔎 evidence anchors, 🧪 checks/evals, 👀 manual review/trace, ⚠️ assumptions/risks, ⛔ not run/not included.
