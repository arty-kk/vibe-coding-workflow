# Billing Entitlements Polish — Plans, Quotas, Gates, and Lifecycle States

## Mode

- Use the active `AGENTS.md` chain.
- Execute mode: change the repository when a focused billing/entitlement improvement is justified by current evidence.

## Goal

Improve one coherent billing, plan, quota, entitlement, or lifecycle surface so UI, API, jobs, tests, and user-facing states align with the repository's actual source of truth.

## Scope selection

- If the user named a plan gate, quota, webhook, provider mapping, billing flow, permission issue, or audit task-sub, improve that owner and directly affected surfaces.
- If the request is broad, inspect high-risk billing/entitlement paths and choose the highest-confidence fix with correctness, revenue, trust, or support impact.
- Include related UI copy/states, server enforcement, tests, docs, jobs, and instrumentation when they belong to the same entitlement problem.
- Avoid new pricing policy, provider migration, broad billing redesign, or business-rule invention unless explicitly required and evidenced.

## Polish targets

- Plan/quota/feature source of truth, provider mapping, route/API guards, UI gates, disabled/no-access/upgrade/over-quota states.
- Subscription lifecycle: trial, upgrade, downgrade, cancel, reactivate, payment failure, grace period, webhook idempotency/order, and reconciliation.
- Tenant/workspace/project/role context and ownership of billing actions, invoices, seats, usage, and notifications.
- Dangerous actions: confirmation, audit-friendly diagnostics, retry behavior, and recovery from partial failures.
- Directly affected tests, fixtures, docs, env examples, and instrumentation where the repo uses them.

## Implementation principles

- Read and preserve the entitlement source of truth before editing consumers.
- Enforce sensitive gates server-side; UI gates are not sufficient for access control.
- Keep visible copy aligned with actual allowed behavior, provider state, and plan/quota contracts.
- Prefer typed matrices/helpers and owner-level tests over scattered string checks.

## Validation

Run relevant repository-native checks. When possible, trace at least one allowed and one restricted plan/role state plus one lifecycle edge. State any inability to verify external provider behavior.
