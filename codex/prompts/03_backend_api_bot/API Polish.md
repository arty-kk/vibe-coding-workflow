# API Polish — Contracts, Errors, Idempotency, and Consumers

## Mode

- Use the active `AGENTS.md` chain.
- Execute mode: change the repository when a focused API improvement is justified by current evidence.

## Goal

Improve one coherent API surface end to end: route/handler, validation, domain/service boundary, persistence side effects, errors, docs, tests, and direct consumers. Do not merely rename fields or tidy controllers while the contract remains ambiguous or inconsistent.

## Scope selection

- If the user named an endpoint, integration, client failure, schema, webhook, SDK call, or contract issue, polish that API surface and directly affected consumers.
- If the request is broad, inspect the main API seams and apply the highest-confidence improvement with contract, safety, or developer-experience impact.
- Include related validation, error, idempotency, permission, observability, docs, and tests when they belong to the same contract.
- Avoid unrelated endpoint redesigns, mass API versioning, dependency changes, and database rewrites unless required by the selected contract fix.

## Polish targets

- Request/response schema clarity, required/optional/null semantics, type coercion, defaults, pagination, sorting, filtering, and versioning behavior.
- Validation boundary: reject malformed input close to the API edge while keeping domain invariants in the owner layer.
- Error model: stable status codes, machine-readable error codes, safe messages, retryability, conflict handling, and not-found/forbidden distinction when security allows it.
- Side effects: idempotency keys, duplicate prevention, transaction boundaries, retries, partial failure, webhooks, background jobs, and cache/index invalidation.
- Consumer contract: generated clients, frontend callers, bot/tool callers, docs/examples, fixtures, and integration tests.
- Operational behavior: rate limits, timeouts, logging, tracing, metrics, and safe diagnostics where repo patterns exist.

## Implementation principles

- Preserve public contracts unless the task explicitly authorizes a breaking change.
- Reuse existing routing, schema, service, repository, auth, error, and test patterns.
- Prefer one source of truth for schemas and shared types over duplicated literals.
- Keep UI/client promises aligned with backend behavior.
- Update directly affected tests, generated artifacts, docs, and examples when the repo uses them.

## Validation

Run repository-native checks for the touched API surface. Prefer endpoint/unit/integration tests that exercise success, validation failure, auth/permission failure, conflict/idempotency, and consumer behavior. If external services or credentials block full validation, state exactly what was not exercised.

## Final response

Respond in Russian with compact emoji sections: ♻️ changed contract, 📁 key files, 🔎 evidence anchors, 🧪 checks, 👀 consumer trace, ⚠️ assumptions/risks, ⛔ not run/not included.
