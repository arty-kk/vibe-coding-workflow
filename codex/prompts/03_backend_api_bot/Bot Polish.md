# Bot Polish — Flows, Navigation, Menus, Copy, and States

## Mode

- Use the active `AGENTS.md` chain.
- Execute mode: change the repository when changes are justified by current evidence.

## Goal

Improve a coherent bot flow or set of related states across navigation, menus, copy, validation, recovery, permissions, and platform constraints. Solve the selected journey end-to-end rather than tweaking one message while adjacent states remain broken.

## Scope selection

- If the user named a command, state, flow, callback, role, chat type, or issue, polish that flow and directly affected states.
- If the request is broad, inspect primary entry points and common bot journeys, then apply the highest-confidence improvements with visible user impact.
- Include related copy, keyboard, validation, stale callback, recovery, and privacy fixes when they belong to the same journey.
- Avoid unrelated features, new integrations, payment/business logic changes, and platform migrations unless the fix requires them.

## Bot-specific targets

- Entry points, `/start`, deep links, `/help`, command list, menus, submenus, stateful navigation, and recovery paths.
- Buttons/keyboards: clear labels, primary/secondary ordering, accessible text, destructive confirmations, stale callback handling, callback payload limits.
- Input prompts: accepted formats, validation, retry copy, cancel/back/home, free-text safety, attachment handling.
- Success/error/status/empty/no-access/unavailable states and async/proactive messages.
- Message formatting, escaping, message length limits, platform-specific keyboard behavior, localization, and privacy constraints.
- Permissions, group/private chat behavior, tenant/account context, and shared copy sources.

## Implementation principles

- Reuse existing routers, scenes/FSM patterns, keyboards, templates, i18n, guards, persistence, and telemetry patterns.
- Fix the flow owner rather than scattering unrelated message edits.
- Preserve current business rules unless the requested polish requires a behavior correction.
- Update directly affected tests, fixtures, snapshots, docs, and localization catalogs when the repo uses them.

## Validation

Run relevant repository-native checks. When explaining non-obvious repo facts, skipped adjacent work, or detected behavior, cite `path:line[-line]` where useful.

Manually trace the changed bot flow from entry to completion/recovery using code paths or available tests.

## Final response

Respond in Russian with compact emoji sections: ♻️ changed surfaces, 📁 key files, 🧪 checks, 👀 manual review/trace, ⚠️ assumptions/risks, ⛔ not run/not included.
