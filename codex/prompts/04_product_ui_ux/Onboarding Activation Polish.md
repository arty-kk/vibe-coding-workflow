# Onboarding Activation Polish — First Run, Setup, and Time-to-Value

## Mode

- Use the active `AGENTS.md` chain.
- Execute mode: change the repository when a focused onboarding or activation improvement is justified by current evidence.

## Goal

Improve one coherent first-run or activation path so a new or returning user reaches the next meaningful product value state safely and clearly. The diff should connect entry point, setup state, copy, navigation, permissions/plan context, recovery, and validation.

## Scope selection

- If the user named an onboarding step, signup handoff, empty state, setup wizard, invite flow, trial/upgrade state, or activation issue, polish that journey.
- If the request is broad, inspect primary activation paths and choose the highest-confidence improvement with measurable completion or support impact.
- Include related UI, copy, state, accessibility, analytics, tests, emails, and docs when they belong to the same activation path.
- Avoid new growth experiments, pricing changes, analytics vendors, or backend rewrites unless required by the selected issue.

## Polish targets

- Entry handoff: public CTA to auth, auth redirect, post-login destination, first-run detection, and next-step CTA.
- Setup: workspace/project/team creation, invitations, sample/demo data, integrations/imports, preferences, defaults, progress/checklist, and completion state.
- Context: role, tenant/workspace/project, plan/trial/quota, upgrade/no-access, and cross-device/session state.
- Recovery: failed setup, partial success, retry, cancel/back, unsaved data, support-safe diagnostics, and dead-end removal.
- Measurement: existing analytics/instrumentation hooks for activation-critical steps, without adding vendors unless the repo already standardizes that path.

## Implementation principles

- Reuse existing route guards, auth/session state, setup components, plan/permission helpers, i18n, and analytics patterns.
- Keep visible promises aligned with implemented product behavior and entitlements.
- Prefer owner-layer fixes for first-run detection and setup state over local page workarounds.
- Preserve existing users' state and migration safety.

## Validation

Run relevant repository-native checks. When possible, trace the path from entry to activation across success, partial, and failure states. Use preview/screenshot tooling when available.
