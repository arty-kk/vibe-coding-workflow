# UX Flow Polish — Journey Continuity, States, Copy, and Recovery

## Mode

- Use the active `AGENTS.md` chain.
- Execute mode: change the repository when a focused UX-flow improvement is justified by current evidence.

## Goal

Improve one coherent user/admin journey from entry to completion. The diff should close the actual flow gap across navigation, state, copy, permissions, validation, and feedback rather than polishing isolated UI fragments.

## Scope selection

- If the user named a flow, route sequence, funnel step, role, plan state, or task-completion issue, polish that journey and directly affected states.
- If the request is broad, inspect primary flows and apply the highest-confidence improvement with meaningful completion, safety, or conversion impact.
- Include related UI/copy/a11y/state/test fixes when they belong to the same journey.
- Avoid unrelated visual redesigns, backend contract changes, dependency changes, and feature expansion unless the flow fix requires them.

## Polish targets

- Entry points, navigation, breadcrumbs, redirects, step order, progress, completion/next-step states, and recovery paths.
- Forms, validation timing, disabled/submit/pending states, destructive confirmations, empty/error/partial-success/retry states, and toasts/alerts.
- Permission/plan/tenant/workspace context, visible vs allowed actions, upgrade/no-access/over-quota copy, and safe diagnostics.
- Accessibility for the journey: focus order, keyboard reachability, status announcements, semantic structure, accessible names.
- Directly affected tests, snapshots, analytics hooks, docs, and localization catalogs when the repo uses them.

## Implementation principles

- Reuse existing components, route conventions, state patterns, validation patterns, tokens, and i18n architecture.
- Keep visible promises aligned with backend behavior and product contracts.
- Prefer the owner layer for shared flow state or permission logic rather than local UI workarounds.
- Preserve unrelated behavior and routes.

## Validation

Run relevant repository-native checks. For UI changes, use preview/screenshot tooling when available; otherwise state the limitation. When possible, trace the journey step-by-step in the final response.

## Final response

Respond in Russian with compact emoji sections: ♻️ changed journey, 📁 key files, 🔎 evidence anchors, 🧪 checks, 👀 manual flow trace, ⚠️ assumptions/risks, ⛔ not run/not included.
