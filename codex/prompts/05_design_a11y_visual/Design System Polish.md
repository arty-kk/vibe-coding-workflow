# Design System Polish — Tokens, Components, Variants, and Stories

## Mode

- Use the active `AGENTS.md` chain.
- Execute mode: change the repository when a focused design-system improvement is justified by current evidence.

## Goal

Improve one coherent design-system owner: a token family, component family, layout primitive, interaction-state pattern, or documented variant set. The diff should reduce drift across consuming surfaces rather than locally polishing one page.

## Scope selection

- If the user named a component, token, style pattern, Storybook story, or drift issue, improve that owner and directly affected usages.
- If the request is broad, inspect repeated UI patterns and choose the highest-confidence system fix with multiple consuming surfaces or high-risk state coverage.
- Include directly affected usage updates, tests, stories, docs, snapshots, and i18n/copy where the repo expects them.
- Avoid new design languages, broad theming rewrites, dependency changes, and visual redesigns not required by the selected system issue.

## Polish targets

- Tokens: semantic names, theme config alignment, repeated values, dark/light/high-contrast variants where existing architecture supports them.
- Components: variant API, state coverage, accessible defaults, responsive behavior, composition boundaries, owner exports, and dead local forks.
- Layout primitives: spacing/density, containers, grids, stacks, headers, sidebars, modals/drawers, and breakpoint behavior.
- Documentation/regression: `DESIGN.md`, component docs, stories, snapshots, visual checks, and examples for important states.
- Migration: update directly affected call sites and remove obsolete local styles only when safe.

## Implementation principles

- Preserve current visual intent while consolidating source of truth.
- Prefer small owner-layer improvements over scattered route-level overrides.
- Keep public component APIs stable unless changing them is necessary and all affected usages are updated.
- Do not hide breaking UI changes behind permissive optional props or silent fallbacks.

## Validation

Run relevant repository-native checks. Use Storybook/preview/screenshot tooling when available; otherwise state the limitation. Verify at least one owner component and one consuming surface when possible.
